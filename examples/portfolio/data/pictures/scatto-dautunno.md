[ Natural light and flare]
 
Hi fooooooolks!
Here's another landscape shot from the last ''trip'' series (am I maybe bothering you too much with these ''nature'' shot?).
Sorry for not uploading anything lately, but it's just sooo busy at uni, I really like the subjects I'm studying but it takes me most of my time and I miss photography sooo badly :-)
Anywaaaay thank god W.E. is just around the corner and I caaaan't wait to enjoy my spare time and shoot something.
 
And how you're doing?
