## Getting Started

I strongly recommend you to use Waffel with [Brunch](http://brunch.io/), starting with the [brunch-with-waffel](https://github.com/moonwave99/brunch-with-waffel) skeleton:

    # in case you do not have Brunch installed yet
    $ npm install brunch -g

    $ brunch new gh:moonwave99/brunch-with-waffel path/to/project
    $ cd path/to/project
    $ npm start

Visit [`http://localhost:3333`](http://localhost:3333) and you ready to go!

Please have a look at the examples here above or at [the doc](docs), in order to get a better grasp on how can Waffel be useful to you.
